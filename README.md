Hi there, David Thorvaldsen here 🦭
 
📜 Long story short: During my IT-classes, in the years of 2015-2017, my high school IT-teacher and my exposure to the subject made me fall in love with programming and coding; and I've now undertaken a BSc, and soon—hopefully by the summer of 2022—a MSc, in Informatics and Robotics at the University of Oslo.

🔭 I’m interested in most things, but as of now my focus is mainly directed towards Computational Self-Awareness in Musical Robots (as it relates to the super-interesting field (imo) of Multi-Agent Systems, and a bit of philosophy and psychology) — as well as (deep) Machine Learning, AI, and Computer Vision.

🌱 I'm currently learning about the above topics, as well as C#, and the game-developing platform Unity. I'm also learning how to write a MSc thesis (in LaTeX using BibLaTeX), and in general how to write better English (from 'The Little Book', as William Strunk Jr. called his short English-writing book 'The Elements of Style' from 1918). To keep track of all my progress, I'm also actively learning more and more Git; hence, this README came into existence (cf. William Lane Craig and the _kalam_ cosmological argument). I really enjoy learning about these things, and find it super interesting!

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on my interests mentioned above (at least after finishing my degree). So if you are too — hit me up! :)
