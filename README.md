Hi there, David Thorvaldsen here!
 
ðŸ“œ During my IT-classes, in the years of 2015-2017, my high school IT-teacher and my exposure to the subject made me fall in love with programming and coding; and since that I've now undertaken a BSc & MSc in Informatics and Robotics at the University of Oslo, doing an exchange semester at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore for half a year. I've also worked as a software engineer & data scientist with leading businesses like KONGSBERG and GE Vingmed Ultrasound.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m interested in most things, but as of my master's thesis my focus was mainly directed towards Computational Self-Awareness in Musical Robots (as it relates to the super-interesting field (imo) of Multi-Agent Systems, and a bit of philosophy and psychology). Now I'm working with deep Machine Learning, AI, and Computer Vision.

ðŸ“« Please do contact me through my e-mail: thorvaldsend@protonmail.com if you're interested in collaborations or the likes :)
