🦭 Hi there, David Thorvaldsen here
 
📜 Long story short: In my IT-classes the years 2015-2017, my high school IT-teacher and my exposure to programming and coding made me fall in love with it, and I've now undertaken a BSc — and soon, hopefully by the summer of 2022, a MSc — in Informatics and Robotics at the University of Oslo. The rest is history.

🔭 I’m interested in most things, but I guess as of now my focus is mainly directed towards Computational Self-Awareness in Musical Robots (as it relates to the super-interesting field (imo), Multi-Agent Systems) — as well as (deep) Machine Learning, AI, and Computer Vision.

🌱 I'm currently learning about the above topics, as well as the (Java-looking imo) programming language C#, and the game-developing platform Unity. I guess I'm also learning how to write a MSc thesis (in LaTeX using BibLaTeX), and in general how to write better English (from 'The Little Book', as William Strunk Jr. called his short English-writing book 'The Elements of Style' after he wrote it himself in 1918). To keep track of all my progress, I'm also actively learning more and more Git; hence, this README came into existence (cf. William Lane Craig and the _kalam_ cosmological argument). I really enjoy learning about these things, and find it super interesting!

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on my interests mentioned above (at least after finishing my degree). So if you are too — hit me up! :)
